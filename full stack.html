    <h1>FULL STACK</h1>
    <BR>
        <P> Full stack development is a technology that is use to make website and applictions that we are using on our devices like phone,tab,laptops. when we are using a website or app so there are 2 components of it.
            first is FRONTEND where we can interact with website and we use trough it and the second component is BACKEND that we can not see 
            but it is on the company server. whatever input we will give to the side it will give us output and this process is going on BACKEND
            . And a full stack developer is doing both for the website whether it is FRONTEND or it is BACKEND. 
        </P>
