        <p><big>AI/ML stands for artificial intelligence and machine learning. These are two closely related fields of computer science that are rapidly transforming the way we live and work.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad term that refers to the ability of machines to mimic human intelligence. AI research has been going on for decades, but it has really taken off in recent years thanks to the availability of large datasets and powerful computing resources.
            Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching machines to learn from data. ML algorithms are trained on data sets, and they use this data to learn how to perform tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering.
